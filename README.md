# Crossover Roadmap
### A never-ending quest to unite all fictional universes.

## Character Eligibility
A character may only be eligible for a crossover if they fulfill the following prerequisites:
1. The character is inherently fictitious.
2. The character is copyrighted at the time of the crossover.
3. The copyrighted version of the character personally appears in the crossover.

## Crossover Magnitude
Crossovers are divided into the following magnitudes:
- **Type 1 (Alpha)** - Two characters from differing universes interact without any inter-dimensional travel, implying that their universes seamlessly coexist.  _These crossovers are considered canon._
- **Type 2 (Beta)** - A character from one universe enters into a different universe by means of inter-dimensional travel, thereby linking the two universes.  _These crossovers are considered canon._
- **Type 3 (Gamma)** - A character from one universe refers to or alludes to another character from a different universe unironically with the implication that the character could be present at any time without the other character ever actually making an appearance.  _These crossovers are considered canon, though they also require the most analysis to confirm and are relegated to Delta status by default until proven otherwise._
- **Type 4 (Delta)** - A character from one universe refers to or alludes to another character from a different universe with the implication that the character is fictitious and couldnâ€™t possibly be present at any time.  _These crossovers are not considered canon._
